                        Understanding mutual funds requires familiarity with certain financial terms:
                    </p>
                    <ul style={{ fontSize: "12pt", marginTop: '15px' }}>
                        <li><strong>Market Cap (Capitalization):</strong> This refers to the total value of a company based on the number of its shares in the stock market based on current market price.</li>

                        <li><strong>Mid Cap:</strong> Stocks that are ranked from 101 to 250 in terms of market capitalization are categorised as mid-cap stocks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Small Cap:</strong> The companies ranked from the 251st position onwards in terms of market capitalization are categorised as small-cap stocks.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong style={{ marginTop: '15px' }}>An Insight into Large-Cap Funds</strong>
                    <p style={{ fontSize: "12pt", marginTop: '15px' }}>
                        A Large Cap Fund is a type of mutual fund that primarily focuses on large cap stocks, with a minimum requirement of at least 80% of its total investments allocated to such stocks.
                    </p>
                    <p style={{ fontSize: "12pt", marginTop: '15px' }}>
                        Large-cap funds primarily invest in well-established companies with a long track record of stability. Think of names like Reliance Industries, Tata Consultancy Services, and HDFC Bank. These companies are well-equipped to navigate economic fluctuations and offer steady, although slower, growth. Investors can expect more predictable performance from these funds. Large-cap funds tend to have lower volatility compared to small and mid-cap funds.
                    </p>
                    <strong style={{ marginTop: '15px' }}>Navigating Mid-Cap Funds</strong>
                    <p style={{ fontSize: "12pt", marginTop: '15px' }}>
                        A Mid Cap Fund is a category of mutual fund that predominantly invests in mid-cap stocks, with a requirement of at least 65% of its assets dedicated to this category.
                    </p>
                    <p style={{ fontSize: "12pt", marginTop: '15px' }}>
                        Mid-cap funds strike a balance between risk and reward. Fund managers invest in medium-sized companies that have outgrown the small-cap category but are yet to reach large-cap status. With these funds, you're betting on potential future growth. Mid-cap funds have the potential for higher growth than large-cap funds. They are less volatile compared to small-cap funds, making them a stable option for investors.
                    </p>
                    <strong style={{ marginTop: '15px' }}>Journeying Through Small-Cap Funds</strong>
                    <p style={{ fontSize: "12pt", marginTop: '15px' }}>
                        A Small Cap Fund is a type of mutual fund that primarily concentrates its investments in small-cap stocks, with a minimum allocation of at least 65% of its total assets to this category.
                    </p>
                    <p style={{ fontSize: "12pt", marginTop: '15px' }}>
                        For adventurous investors, small-cap funds may hold great appeal. These funds invest in small, promising companies with significant growth potential. Small-cap funds offer the potential for high returns, making them attractive to risk-tolerant investors. They provide untapped growth potential as these companies are often off the radar of large institutional investors.
                    </p>
                    <p style={{ fontSize: "12pt", marginTop: '15px' }}>
                        Here's a valuable piece of advice: Diversification is crucial in any investment strategy. Never put all your funds into a single category.
                    </p>
                    <strong style={{ marginTop: '15px' }}>Conclusion</strong>
                    <p style={{ fontSize: "12pt", marginTop: '15px' }}>
                        While investing isn't one-size-fits-all, understanding large, mid, and small-cap funds can significantly impact your financial journey. It's important to note that there's no "best" category—each one offers unique opportunities.
                    </p>
                    <p style={{ fontSize: "12pt", marginTop: '15px' }}>
                        The real secret is aligning your choice with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon.
