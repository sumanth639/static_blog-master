        <strong>Common Behavioral Biases in Investing</strong>
        <p style={{ fontSize: '12pt', marginTop: '15px' }}>
          Investing isn't just about market trends and data—it's also influenced
          by psychology. Emotional biases often lead investors to make
          irrational decisions, affecting financial outcomes.
        </p>

        <strong style={{ marginTop: '15px' }}>
          1. Loss Aversion: The Fear of Losing
        </strong>
        <p style={{ fontSize: '12pt', marginTop: '15px' }}>
          Many investors fear losses more than they appreciate gains. This
          results in holding onto underperforming investments for too long or
          selling winners too soon.
          <br />
          <strong>Solution:</strong> Focus on long-term financial goals rather
          than short-term market fluctuations. Diversification can also mitigate
          risks.
        </p>

        <strong style={{ marginTop: '15px' }}>
          2. Overconfidence: The Illusion of Expertise
        </strong>
        <p style={{ fontSize: '12pt', marginTop: '15px' }}>
          Overconfidence leads investors to overestimate their ability to
          predict markets, often resulting in excessive trading and risk
          exposure.
          <br />
          <strong>Solution:</strong> Regularly review investment performance
          with objective data and seek professional advice.
        </p>

        <strong style={{ marginTop: '15px' }}>
          3. Herd Mentality: Following the Crowd
        </strong>
        <p style={{ fontSize: '12pt', marginTop: '15px' }}>
          FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) often pushes investors to buy at market
          highs or panic-sell during downturns.
          <br />
          <strong>Solution:</strong> Stick to a well-defined investment plan
          rather than reacting emotionally to market trends.
        </p>

        <strong style={{ marginTop: '15px' }}>
          4. Recency Bias: Overweighting Recent Events
        </strong>
        <p style={{ fontSize: '12pt', marginTop: '15px' }}>
          Investors tend to believe that recent market movements will continue
          indefinitely, ignoring historical patterns.
          <br />
          <strong>Solution:</strong> Review long-term data to avoid making
          short-sighted decisions.
        </p>

        <strong style={{ marginTop: '15px' }}>
          5. Anchoring Bias: Fixation on Initial Information
        </strong>
        <p style={{ fontSize: '12pt', marginTop: '15px' }}>
          Some investors fixate on the purchase price of an asset rather than
          reassessing its value based on current market conditions.
          <br />
          <strong>Solution:</strong> Make investment decisions based on updated
          research rather than past benchmarks.
        </p>

        <strong style={{ marginTop: '15px' }}>
          Strategies to Overcome Biases
        </strong>
        <p style={{ fontSize: '12pt', marginTop: '15px' }}>
          • Create a Financial Plan – A structured plan ensures consistency in
          investment decisions.
          <br />
          • Use Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) – Automating investments
          helps mitigate emotional decision-making.
          <br />
          • Diversify Your Portfolio – Spreading investments across asset
          classes reduces risk exposure.
          <br />
          • Seek Professional Guidance – An experienced Mutual Fund Distributor
          provides objective insights.
          <br />
          • Stay Educated – Understanding market cycles and historical trends
          enhances decision-making.
          <br />• Regular Reviews and Rebalancing – Periodic portfolio
          evaluations keep investments aligned with financial goals.
        </p>
