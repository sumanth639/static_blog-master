        <strong>The Reality Check: Health Risks Are Unpredictable</strong>
        <p style={{ fontSize: '12pt', marginTop: '15px' }}>
          Many millennials once believed that good health and youth were enough
          to shield them from significant medical expenses. However, the
          pandemic proved otherwise. Young, healthy individuals found themselves
          facing hefty hospital bills, long recovery periods, and unforeseen
          medical complications.

          Escalating Healthcare Costs and Financial Strain
        </strong>
        <p style={{ fontSize: '12pt', marginTop: '15px' }}>
          Medical expenses have skyrocketed, making even routine treatments
          costly. For a generation already managing student loans and rising
          living costs, unexpected medical bills can be financially crippling.
          Without adequate insurance, a single hospital visit could derail
          financial stability.

          Beyond Physical Health: The Rise of Mental Health Coverage
        </strong>
        <p style={{ fontSize: '12pt', marginTop: '15px' }}>
          Millennials have been vocal advocates for mental health awareness.
          Anxiety, depression, and burnout became widespread issues, leading to
          a greater demand for insurance policies that cover therapy,
          counseling, and psychiatric treatments.

        <strong style={{ marginTop: '15px' }}>
          Employer Insurance Isn't Enough
        </strong>
        <p style={{ fontSize: '12pt', marginTop: '15px' }}>
          Many millennials learned that employer-provided health insurance can
          be unreliable, especially during job losses and career shifts. Having
          an independent health plan ensures continuous coverage, regardless of
          employment status.

          Preventive Healthcare: A Smarter Approach
        </strong>
        <p style={{ fontSize: '12pt', marginTop: '15px' }}>
          The shift from reactive to preventive healthcare is driving
          millennials toward comprehensive insurance plans. Policies that cover
          regular health check-ups, wellness programs, and preventive screenings
          are becoming more attractive.
        </p>

        <strong style={{ marginTop: '15px' }}>
          Customized Insurance Plans for a New Generation
        </strong>
        <p style={{ fontSize: '12pt', marginTop: '15px' }}>
          Insurance providers are recognizing millennials' evolving needs by
          offering flexible, tailored plans. Features like affordable premiums,
          critical illness riders, and alternative treatment coverage make
          health insurance more relevant.

        <strong style={{ marginTop: '15px' }}>
          Health Insurance as a Key to Financial Freedom
        </strong>
        <p style={{ fontSize: '12pt', marginTop: '15px' }}>
          Financial planning isn't just about saving and investing—it's also
          about protecting yourself from unforeseen risks. Millennials are
          realizing that health insurance plays a crucial role in maintaining
          financial stability and long-term wealth-building.

          Final Thoughts: Secure Your Future Today
        </strong>
        <p style={{ fontSize: '12pt', marginTop: '15px' }}>
          The post-pandemic world has reinforced the importance of financial
          preparedness. Millennials who once viewed health insurance as an
          afterthought are now embracing it as fundamental. A well-structured
          insurance plan protects both your health and financial goals.
