        <strong>Understanding Inflation & Its Impact on Your Wealth</strong>
        <p style={{ fontSize: '12pt', marginTop: '15px' }}>
          Inflation is the silent force that reduces your money's purchasing
          power over time. For long-term financial security, it is essential to
          invest wisely to ensure your returns consistently outpace inflation.
        </p>

        <strong style={{ marginTop: '15px' }}>
          The Impact of Inflation on Investments
        </strong>
        <p style={{ fontSize: '12pt', marginTop: '15px' }}>
          <strong>Fixed Deposits & Savings Accounts:</strong> While safe, their
          low returns often fail to keep pace with inflation. If inflation is at
          6% and your FD earns 4%, your real return is negative (-2%).
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Bonds & Fixed-Income Investments:</strong> May not generate
          inflation-beating returns and are impacted by interest rate
          fluctuations.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Cash Holdings:</strong> Holding too much cash results in
          guaranteed loss of purchasing power.

          How Mutual Funds Help Beat Inflation
        </strong>
        <p style={{ fontSize: '12pt', marginTop: '15px' }}>
          <strong>1. Equity Mutual Funds for Long-Term Growth</strong>
          <br />
          Historically, stock markets have outperformed inflation, making equity
          funds ideal for wealth creation.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>2. Hybrid Funds for Balanced Returns</strong>
          <br />
          Combine equities and debt instruments to mitigate risks while offering
          better returns than traditional options.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>3. Debt Mutual Funds for Stability</strong>
          <br />
          Provide better returns than fixed deposits while managing risk
          effectively.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>4. Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) for Consistency</strong>
          <br />
          Through rupee cost averaging, you accumulate more units when prices
          are low, helping build wealth steadily.
        </p>

        <strong style={{ marginTop: '15px' }}>
          Why Mutual Funds Are a Smart Choice During Inflation
        </strong>
        <p style={{ fontSize: '12pt', marginTop: '15px' }}>
          • <strong>Professional Management:</strong> Expert fund managers
          optimize returns
          <br />• <strong>Diversification:</strong> Spreading investments
          reduces risk exposure
          <br />• <strong>Flexibility:</strong> Caters to different risk
          appetites and goals
          <br />• <strong>Liquidity:</strong> Easy access to funds when needed
        </p>

        <strong style={{ marginTop: '15px' }}>Conclusion</strong>
        <p style={{ fontSize: '12pt', marginTop: '15px' }}>
          Inflation is inevitable, but its impact can be managed with the right
          investment strategy. Mutual funds, especially equity and hybrid funds,
          provide an effective hedge against inflation while offering long-term
          growth potential.
