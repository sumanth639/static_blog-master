        <strong>Understanding Lifestyle Inflation</strong>
        <p style={{ fontSize: '12pt', marginTop: '15px' }}>
          When your income rises, it's tempting to increase your spending
          proportionally. While upgrading your standard of living is expected to
          some extent, if expenses always match (or exceed) earnings, it can
          lead to financial stagnation.
        </p>

        <strong style={{ marginTop: '15px' }}>
          Why Lifestyle Inflation Can Be Dangerous
        </strong>
        <p style={{ fontSize: '12pt', marginTop: '15px' }}>
          It slows down wealth accumulation - if every extra rupee earned is
          spent rather than saved or invested, you're not actually building
          wealth. It creates financial vulnerability as higher expenses make you
          dependent on your current income level. It keeps financial freedom out
          of reach as early retirement or financial independence require
          disciplined savings.
        </p>

        <strong style={{ marginTop: '15px' }}>
          How to Avoid Lifestyle Inflation While Living Well
        </strong>
        <p style={{ fontSize: '12pt', marginTop: '15px' }}>
          Implement the 50-30-20 Rule: 50% on necessities, 30% on discretionary
          spending, and 20% on savings and investments. Prioritize investing
          before spending - when you get a raise, increase your investments
          first. Differentiate between wants and needs by asking if purchases
          add long-term value. Build a financial safety net with an emergency
          fund covering 6-12 months of expenses.
        </p>

        <strong style={{ marginTop: '15px' }}>Smart Financial Habits</strong>
        <p style={{ fontSize: '12pt', marginTop: '15px' }}>
          Choose experiences over material possessions as they bring
          longer-lasting happiness. Practice lifestyle lagging by delaying
          upgrades after salary increases to boost investments first. Remember
          that true wealth is measured not by how much you earn but by how much
          you save and grow through investments.
          <br />
          Earning more should be an opportunity to grow your wealth, not just
          your expenses. By implementing mindful spending habits and
          prioritizing investments, you can achieve financial security while
          enjoying your success.
        </p>

        <strong style={{ marginTop: '15px' }}>Final Thought</strong>
        <p style={{ fontSize: '12pt', marginTop: '15px' }}>
          The next time you receive a raise, ask yourself: Do I want to appear
          wealthy, or do I want to become truly wealthy? The choice is yours.
          Choose wisely.
